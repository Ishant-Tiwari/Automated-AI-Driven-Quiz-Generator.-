üöÄ Project: AI-Driven Quiz Generator üñ•Ô∏è
I‚Äôm thrilled to share the successful completion of our AI-Driven Quiz Generator project, designed to revolutionize education by automating quiz creation, distribution, and performance tracking for both teachers and students.
üîç Key Highlights:
Automated Quiz Creation: Leveraged AI to generate personalized quizzes with high accuracy and relevance.
Seamless Integration: Integrated Google APIs for effortless distribution and performance monitoring.
Scalability: Designed with a user-friendly interface suitable for both small classrooms and large institutions.
Technologies Used: OpenCV, Python-PPTX, Pandas, Flask, Streamlit, and Google APIs.

The AI-Driven Quiz Generator also automates the delivery and distribution of quizzes, ensuring a seamless experience for teachers and students alike.
 Once the quiz is generated, it is automatically sent to the designated recipients via integrated platforms like Google Forms. 
 This removes the manual effort of distributing quizzes, making it more efficient and time-saving for educators. Additionally, the system
 tracks performance in real-time, allowing for quick feedback and insights into student progress. All of this is achieved through the power of AI and Google API integration, creating a truly automated learning experience.
